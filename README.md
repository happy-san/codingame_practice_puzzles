# Codingame Practice Puzzles

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/happy-san/codingame_practice_puzzles.svg?branch=trunk)](https://travis-ci.com/happy-san/codingame_practice_puzzles)

Solutions to the puzzles implemented in Dart.

## Motive
My main motive to create this repository is to showcase my command on the Dart language.

While this was not my initial motive, the limitations(lack of auto-complete due to latency, etc) that I felt in the online IDE of CodinGame lead me to create [`test generator`](/test/test_generator.dart) which I use to generate the boilerplate-code of the test for each puzzle which in turn enables me to code locally. If you're a fellow gamer give it a try.

## Plagiarism
Since I am implementing solutions to the puzzles which are associated with experience points/levels in the CodinGame ecosystem and especially since CodinGame doesn't allow the user to even view other solutions before they've themselves first implemented a passing solution, I feel obliged to clarify that this repository is not meant to be used to promote plagiarism.
